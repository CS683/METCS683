# Lab4
## Description
Based on the example we discuss in this module, add the following features into your previous lab3 submission:
- Database Implementation
  - Use a database to store Project data. It is easier to use Room as we discussed in the module. 
  - Complete the add project functionality, so that the new project can be added into the database and displayed on the screen. 
  - Make sure the favorite setting is also stored correctly in the database whenever the user changes it. 
- Show Favorite Projects
 - Add a "show favorite projects only" checkbox (or toggle button or switch) on the project list screen.
 - This setting (whether it will show only favorite projects) should be stored into and received from the shared preferences so that it can be remembered across different sessions.
 - If it is set, only list all favorite projects from the database. (optional)
## What to submit
- A lab report including the explanation of your design and implementaion, and the screenshots for testing results.
- A zip file of your source code
