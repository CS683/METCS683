# Lab2
## Description

In this lab, we wiill need to make the following changes based on the Projectportal example code we discussed in the class.
- Modify the Project data class (Project.kt). Besides the project title and summary, we also want to know other information about the project such as:
  - Authors of the project
  - Project links: (e.g. youtube links, github links, etc)
  - Is this project your favorite project or do you like this project?
  - Keywords that can be used to search the project
  - Any additional information you would like to add
  - Hint: You should modify the Project data class to include the above information, e.g. boolean isFavorite/like, List links, List authors, etc.
- Modify the  UI: Add proper widgets to display and edit these additional information (e.g. authors, links keywords).
- Add a proper widget to let the user set (or unset) a project as their favorite project on the project when displaying the project details on the screen. Do not add this when editing the information of the project.   

## What to submit: 
- On blackboard
  - A lab report fie in pdf or doc, including 
   - your github repo URL link
   - a description of how you designed and implemented the above requirements. Please also report any issues you have encountered and the screenshots to show the execution result. *Please specify what device or virtual device you used to execute your program.*
