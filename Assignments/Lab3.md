# Lab3
## Objectives
- Learn how to display a collection of data
- Learn how to use navigate between different screens
- Learn how to use ViewModels to feed data to UI screens 
 
## Description 
Based on either one of the two examples mentioned above, add the following features into your previous lab2 submission:
- The ProjectList Screen
  - Add a ProjectList screen to list all projects in your project. You can just display the project title in the list as we did in the lecture example.
  - Add the communication between the projectlist screen and your project detail screen that you completed in lab2, so that when you click on a project in the ProjectList screen, the corresponding project detail will be displayed, including project title, description, authors, links and whether you like the project. 
- The AddProject Screen
  - Add another AddProject screen or reuse the EditProject screen to allow the user to add a new project and detailed information about that project into the system. 
  - Connect the AddProject Screen to the Project. For example, add a "+" Button in the Project List Screen, when clicking on it, it goes to the AddProject screen.  
  - On the AddProject screen, you can use a submit button. When it is clicked, the new project should be added into the project list, and it will switch back to the ProjectList screen with the new added project displayed.
