- Please name your report as CS683_\<your name\>_\<ProjectTitle\>. It can be either a PDF or Word document. 
- Make sure to push all your code into your github repository and submit your source code in a zip file named CS683_\<your name\>_\<ProjectTitle\>.zip on blackboard. 
- Please provide your feedback in the “Add comments” section when submitting your lab report. Thanks! 


## Overview

*(This section should give an overview of your project. It should include the motivation, the purpose and the potential users of the proposed application. This section should be completed in iteration 0 as part of your proposal. It can be modified in later iterations.)*

## Related Work

*(This section should describe some similar apps and the similarities or differences between yours and other applications.
)*

## Requirement Analysis and Testing 

*(This section should clearly describe all features/requirements that you plan to implement or have implemented for your application. You should separate them into three categories: essential, desirable and optional.
 
|Title<br>(Essential/Desirable/Optional) |  |
|---|---|
|Description|  |
|Mockups| |
|Acceptance Tests| |
|Test Results| |
|Status| |

For example: 

|Title(Essential/Desirable/Optional)<br> |View project details (Essential)|
|---|---|
|Description|As a user, I want to view the details of a project so that I can have a better idea about that project.  |
|Mockups|You can put one or more mockups here. |
|Acceptance Tests|Given a project list is shown on the screen, <br> When the user clicks on one project on the list, <br>Then the project details will be displayed on the screen, including project title, brief description, implementation stack, authors, keywords, project links, etc.|
|Test Results| You can provide some screenshots of the execution result.|
|Status|Iteration 1: implemented the project detail UI page <br> Iteration 2: Implemented User click event<br> Iteration 3: Implemented project database. Completed. |)* 

## Design and Implementation

*(This section should describe the basic architecture (e.g. MVC, or MVVM) and your detailed design and implementation.  This section may contain the following aspects:
- Basic architecture
- UI design and implementation
-- Activities, fragments, special widgets, etc
- Other android features 
-- Service, sensors, animations, etc
- Third party APIs
- Data Design and implementation 
-- Database schema, data storage 
- Algorithms
…
    
You can provide some brief description as well as supporting evidence, such as sample code, log info, or screenshots. You want to specify mapped requirements and files/classes in your project. 
This section is not needed for iteration 0. In later iterations, you shall highlight the work you are doing  in the current iteration. )*

## Project Structure
*(Please provide a screenshot(s) of your current project structure, which should show all the packages, kotlin/java files and resource files in your project. You should also highlight any files/packages you have changed, added/deleted in this iteration compared with the previous iteration. This is not needed for iteration 0)*
    
## Timeline

*(Please provide  a summary of the requirements implemented and Android/third party components used in the past and current iterations, and the plan in the future iteration.)*

|Iteration | Application Requirements (Eseential/Desirable/Optional) | Android Components and Features| member 1 contribution/tasks| member 2 contribution/tasks|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1| | | | |
|2| | | | |
|3| | | | |


## Future Work (Optional)
*(This section can describe possible future works. Particularly the requirements you planned but didn’t get time to implement, and possible Android components or features to implement them. 
This section is optional, and you can include this section in the final iteration if you want.)*

    
##Project Demo Links
*(For on campus students, we will have project presentations in class. For online students, you are required to submit a video of your project presentation which includes a demo of your app. You can use Kaltura to make the video and then submit it on blackboard. Please check the following link for the details of using Kaltura to make and submit videos on blackboard. You can also use other video tools and upload your video to youtube if you like: https://onlinecampus.bu.edu/bbcswebdav/courses/00cwr_odeelements/metcs/cs_Kaltura.htm  )*
